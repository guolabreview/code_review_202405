# Scripts for CUT&Tag data analysis
Cleavage Under Targets & Tagmentation (CUT&Tag) is a tethering method that uses a protein-A/G-Tn5 (pA/G-Tn5) transposome fusion protein. The improved signal-to-noise relative to ChIP-seq translates to an order-of-magnitude reduction in the amount of sequencing required to map chromatin features. CUT&Tag libraries in this study were constructed according to the manufacturer’s protocol for the Hyperactive Universal CUT&Tag Assay Kit (Vazyme, Cat# TD904).

The processing pipeline follows [CUTTag_tutorial](https://yezhengstat.github.io/CUTTag_tutorial/index.html) from Steven Henikoff’s Lab. Codes for processing CUT&Tag data can be found in the “Basic_Data_Processing” folder. And, “Figure_Visualizing” folder for reproducing relevant figures in our manuscript.

**ALL CODES ARE IN "codes_for_review.rar" AND CAN BE VIEWED VIA TOKEN PROVIDED IN REBUTTAL.**
